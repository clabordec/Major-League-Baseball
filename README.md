# Major League Baseball

<br>

## Overview
This project analyzes decades' worth of Major League Baseball (MLB) data, including player statistics such as schools attended, salaries, teams played for, height, and weight. Using SQL queries and advanced database techniques, we extract insights into player careers, team spending, and player attributes.

<br>

## Objectives
The primary goals of this analysis are:
1. **Identify Schools Attended by MLB Players** - Determine which schools have produced the most MLB players.
2. **Analyze Team Salary Spending** - Assess how much each team spends on player salaries over the years.
3. **Examine Player Careers** - Track the career paths of individual players, including teams played for and performance over time.
4. **Compare Player Attributes** - Investigate height, weight, and other player characteristics to uncover patterns and trends.

## Skills Utilized
This project leverages SQL database techniques, including:
- **MySQL** - Managing and querying structured data.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** - Organizing complex queries for readability and efficiency.
- **Subqueries** - Extracting insights from nested queries.
- **Window Functions** - Performing calculations across partitions of data.
- **JOINs** - Combining multiple tables to create meaningful relationships.
- **Functions by Data Type** - Using appropriate functions for text, numerical, and date-based data.

## Features
- Comprehensive analysis of MLB player data.
- SQL queries optimized for performance and readability.
- Insights into team spending, player careers, and attributes.
- Data visualizations for better interpretation of trends.
- Well-documented query explanations and database schema.

## Use Cases
- **Scouting & Recruitment** - Identifying schools that consistently produce top-tier MLB players.
- **Team Budgeting** - Analyzing how teams allocate salaries to improve financial planning.
- **Player Performance Analysis** - Tracking player careers to understand performance trends and longevity.
- **Attribute Comparisons** - Evaluating player attributes to uncover trends in height, weight, and other factors.

## Deliverables
- SQL queries for extracting insights from MLB data.
- Data visualizations and reports on player statistics and team spending.
- Documentation detailing the database schema and query explanations.
- Jupyter notebooks or SQL scripts for reproducibility.
